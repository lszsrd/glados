# Variables

Variables in Rizz must be **explicitly declared and bound**.

Next, we'll create a variable to store data, like this: `Int car = 5;`

This line creates a new variable named "car" and binds it to the value "5". In Rizz, variables need to be bound.

Every variable must have a **type** and an **initial value**.
